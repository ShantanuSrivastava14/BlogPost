                    React.js is a Javascript library for building user interfaces , primary for web application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    React was created by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook along with a community of individual developers and companies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    React allows developers to build reusable UI components. Components are like building blocks of a React application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In React, you describe what you want your UI to look like, and React takes care updating the UI when your data changes. This approach makes code more predictable and easier to debug
                </li>
                <li>
                    React uses a virtual DOM to optimize performance. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM, and React updates the actual DOM only when necessary, minimizing costly DOM manipulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    React uses JSX, a syntax extension that looks like HTML, to describe UI elements. JSX makes it easier to write and understand the structure of your UI components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                React components can maintain internal state (data that changes over time). When the state changes, React automaticallly re-renders the affected components.
                            </td>
                            <td>

                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, making components more dynamic and reusable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In React, data flows in one direction, from parent to child components. This makes it easier to track how data changes and debug issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    React has a rich ecosystem with many libraries and tools built around it, such as React Router for routing, and Redux for state management. There's also a large community that contributes to the development and improvement of React.
                </li>

                                React can also be used to build mobile applications through React Native, which allows you to use React's component-based approach to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android.

                    React includes features like memoization, lazy loading, and hooks like useMemo and useCallback to optimize performance in large applications.

                Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular is maintained by Google and a community of developers. It was a complete rewrite of AngularJS, the original version, and is sometimes referred to as "Angular 2+".
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular applications are built using components, which are the basic building blocks of the user interface. Each component is a self-contained piece of the UI.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular is built using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static types. This helps catch errors early in development and improves code quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular supports two-way data binding, which means changes in the UI are reflected in the underlying data model and vice versa, making it easier to synchronize the view and model.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular uses dependency injection to manage the components' dependencies. This improves modularity, testability, and reusability of code.
            </li>
            <li>

                        <td>
                            Angular applications are organized into modules, which group related components, services, and other code. This modular structure makes the application easier to manage and scale.
                        </td>

            </li>
            <li>
                Angular uses directives to extend HTML with new syntax and capabilities. Directives can manipulate the DOM, add behavior to elements, or even create new HTML elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular uses services to handle business logic and data retrieval. Services can be injected into components and other services, promoting code reusability and separation of concerns.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular supports reactive programming with RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript). This allows for handling asynchronous data streams and events in a more flexible and composable way.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular includes a powerful router for building single-page applications with multiple views and navigation. The router supports lazy loading, route guards, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular provides robust form handling capabilities, including template-driven and reactive forms. This makes it easy to build and manage forms with validation, error handling, and dynamic fields.
            </li>
            <li>
                Angular includes features like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, tree shaking, and lazy loading to optimize the performance of applications.
            </li>

                    React is a JavaScript library primarily focused on building user interfaces. It provides the view layer of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and relies on other libraries or frameworks for additional functionality like routing, state management, and form handling.</li></ul>
